# FSystem

FSystem is a operating system meant for computers 
compatible with x86 that have legacy support.
You can run programs off a hard disk or a 
flash drive. Make sure to remove all disks
in your system that don't have FSystem 
installed or FSystem programs.

# Disclamer :

If you are loading a program off
of a flash drive make sure that it is
detected as a USB hard disk in
the bios.

# Disk setup requirement

In order for FSystem to work, all disks
must be set up in this order.

Disk 1 : FSystem boot drive 
Disk 2 : Program medium

Do NOT attach additional disks to the system!

# Commands
